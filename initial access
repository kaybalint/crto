DELIVERY(CONTAINER(TRIGGER + PAYLOAD + DECOY))

delivery: the technique used to deliver the package to the victim
container: the container format used to package the files
trigger: the means to trigger payload execution
payload: the malicious code to execute
decoy: a file to display to the victim, should follow the pretext (same file type as trigger)

payload techniques:
  DLL hijacking: forces legit application to use malicious DLL
    abuses the DLL search order (current dir, system dir, etc.)
    can find opportunities by searching procmon for path ends in DLL and result is NAME NOT FOUND
