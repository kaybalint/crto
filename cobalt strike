three parts to cobalt strike:
      beacon: post-exploitation agent, responsible for communicating back to server. implemented as a DLL but can be packaged into payloads of various formats
      team server: central control and logging system which stores information collected during an engagement
      client: used by the red team to connect to one or more team servers to manage and interact with beacon payloads

listeners define the protocol and parameters by which a beacon payload communicates w/ a team server
      provided by default: HTTP/S, DNS, SMB, TCP
      split into two types:
            egress: egress beacon communicates directly to a team server (DNS and HTTP/S)
            peer-to-peer (P2P): has its traffic routed through another beacon (SMB and TCP) and ultimately will be linked to an egress beacon to reach the team server

HTTP/S listeners:
      the team server starts a built-in web server to serve the requests
      GETs to fetch tasks from the team server
      POSTs to send back the results

HTTP/S hosts:
      IP or domain name that the beacon will send its HTTP/S requests to
      this IP or domain may resolve directly to a team server or a redirector (iptables, socat, nginx, etc.)
      host rotation strategies:
            round robin: loops through host list top-to-bottom
            random: randomly selected host
            failover: failover-x or failover-m/h/d
            rotate: rotate-m/h/d where each host is used for the given time period and then rotated to next in list
      max retry strategies:
            none: will run indefinitely 
            exit: exit-[max_attempts]-[increase_attempts]-[duration]
                  e.g. exit-50-25-1h tells the beacon to increase sleep time to 1h after 25 failed attempts and exit at 50 failed attempts
      guardrails:
            prevent stageless beacon payloads from running unless specific criteria is met (such as hostname, username, IP, etc.)

DNS listener:
      the team server starts a built-in web DNS server to serve the requests
      communicates via DNS requests, such as A, AAAA, TXT record lookups
      NOTE: must add the nedded DNS records to make the team server authoritative for one or more subdomains
      the beacon checks in with the server with an A record lookup
      the 'checkin' command transmits the beacon's metadata

SMB listener:
      this listener does not bind or listen on the team server
      the SMB beacon payload will create an SMB pipe using the pipename specified
      another beacon will then be used to connect to the named pipe and relay traffic

TCP listener:
      this listener does not bind or listen on the team server
      the TCP beacon payload will bind and listen on the port specified
      another beacon will then be used to connect to the port and relay traffic
