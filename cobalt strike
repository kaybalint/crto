three parts to cobalt strike:
      beacon: post-exploitation agent, responsible for communicating back to server. implemented as a DLL but can be packaged into payloads of various formats
      team server: central control and logging system which stores information collected during an engagement
      client: used by the red team to connect to one or more team servers to manage and interact with beacon payloads

listeners define the protocol and parameters by which a beacon payload communicates w/ a team server
      provided by default: HTTP/S, DNS, TCP, SMB
      split into two types:
            egress: egress beacon communicates directly to a team server (DNS and HTTP/S)
            peer-to-peer (P2P): has its traffic routed through another beacon (SMB and TCP) and ultimately will be linked to an egress beacon to reach the team server

HTTP/S listeners:
      the team server starts a built-in web server to serve the requests
      GETs to fetch tasks from the team server
      POSTs to send back the results

HTTP/S hosts:
      IP or domain name that the beacon will send its HTTP/S requests to
      this IP or domain may resolve directly to a team server or a redirector (iptables, socat, nginx, etc.)
      host rotation strategies:
            round robin: loops through host list top-to-bottom
            random: randomly selected host
            failover: failover-x or failover-m/h/d
            rotate: rotate-m/h/d where each host is used for the given time period and then rotated to next in list
      max retry strategies:
            none: will run indefinitely 
            exit: exit-[max_attempts]-[increase_attempts]-[duration]
                  e.g. exit-50-25-1h tells the beacon to increase sleep time to 1h after 25 failed attempts and exit at 50 failed attempts
