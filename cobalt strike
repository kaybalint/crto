three parts to cobalt strike:
      beacon: post-exploitation agent, responsible for communicating back to server. implemented as a DLL but can be packaged into payloads of various formats
      team server: central control and logging system which stores information collected during an engagement
      client: used by the red team to connect to one or more team servers to manage and interact with beacon payloads

listeners define the protocol and parameters by which a beacon payload communicates w/ a team server
      provided by default: HTTP/S, DNS, TCP, SMB
      split into two types:
            egress: egress beacon communicates directly to a team server (DNS and HTTP/S)
            peer-to-peer (P2P): has its traffic routed through another beacon (SMB and TCP) and ultimately will be linked to an egress beacon to reach the team server

HTTP/S listeners:
      the team server starts a built-in web server to serve the requests
      GETs to fetch tasks from the team server
      POSTs to send back the results
