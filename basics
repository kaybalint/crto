emulation: specific threats, narrow in scope, leaverages known TTPs
simulation: simulates hypothetical threats, broad scope, leverages unknown/unique TTPs

primum non nocere: "first, do no harm"

OPSEC: operations security 
  likelihood of actions being observed and interrupted by a blue team

threat intelligence: evidence based knowledge about exisiting or emerging threats 
standards to rationalize TI-related data in a common format:
  Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC)
  Cyber Observables (CybOX)
  Microsoft Interflow 
  Structured Threat Information (STIX)
  Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII) 

targeted attack lifecycle:
  initial recon -> inital compromise -> foothold -> priv esc -> internal recon -> lateral movement -> persistence -> complete mission

goal planning:
  what ability does a threat have to gain physical and/or remote access?
  what ability does a threat have to gain elevated (local and/or domain admin) access?
  what ability does a threat have to move freely throughout a network?
  what ability does a threat have to identify and access sensitive information?
  what ability does a threat have to exfiltrate sensitive data?
  how long can a threat go undetected and what must a threat do to initiate a reaction from the organisation?
  what are the potential business impacts a threat could realise?

do's:
  log all actions
  understand the tools
  be aware, maintain situational awareness

dont's:
  use untested or pre-compiled tools
  use unecrypted channels for C2
  exfiltrate restricted data
  disable security controls
